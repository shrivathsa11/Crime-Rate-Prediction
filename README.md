# Crime-Rate-Prediction
The "Crime Rate Prediction and Analysis" project uses Python and K-means clustering to group Indian districts based on crime patterns like Murder, Rape, and Theft. This helps identify areas with similar crime profiles, supporting better policy-making, resource allocation, and crime prevention efforts for safer communities.
